Predicting Churning of Bank Customers using ANN
Overview
This project aims to predict whether a bank customer will churn or not using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). The dataset contains information about bank customers such as their credit score, gender, age, tenure, balance, number of products they have, whether they have a credit card, whether they are active, and their estimated salary.

Data Source
The dataset used in this project is available on Kaggle: Churn Modelling.

Technologies Used
Python
Jupyter Notebook
Keras
Scikit-learn

Steps Involved
1. Data Exploration:
Explores the dataset to understand the features and characteristics of the data.

2. Data Cleaning and Preparation:
Cleans and prepares the data for machine learning by filling in missing values, encoding categorical variables, and creating new features.

3. Feature Scaling:
Scales the features to ensure that all features are on a similar scale.

4. Model Building:
Builds an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model using Keras to predict whether a customer will churn or not.

5. Model Evaluation:
Evaluates the performance of the ANN model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

6. Hyperparameter Tuning:
Fine-tunes the parameters of the best performing model using grid search to improve its performance.

7. Prediction:
Uses the final model to predict whether a new customer will churn or not.

Conclusion
This project demonstrates how to use Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) to predict whether a bank customer will churn or not. By following the steps outlined in this project, one can learn how to clean and prepare data for machine learning, build and evaluate an ANN model, and make predictions on new data. The Jupyter Notebook on GitHub allows anyone to reproduce the results and further explore the dataset.
